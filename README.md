hello this is not done,, download if you want, functionality of the old version should still work but there's nothing new really.

Note incompatability with Autojoin, due to how this mod functions when getting the name of the server. (it gets the name of the server via the server browser, however as the autojoin mod bypasses the server browser, it cannot get the name of the server.)
